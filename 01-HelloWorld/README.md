# Rust Basic Commands

To instantly compile and rust, we can use `rustc` binary like this

```sh
rustc main.rs
./main
```

But to create a rust project, we can use rust's package manager, `cargo`

```sh
cargo new hello-world #create rust project with dir called hello-world
cargo build #build the project
cargo run #run the project
```
